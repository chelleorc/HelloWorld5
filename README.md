## What Does it Do?
#### With the tap on the screen, you can change the background and text to a different color, tap to view the surprise message, and enter your own message. 

## Why Did I Build This?
#### I want to learn how to build applications and am applying to CodePath's *Introduction to Mobile Apps* course. This is the pre-work required and include features that were an optional part of the build.

## How Do You Use It?
** Note: I have only tested this on Android Studio **

#### Clone this repo to Android Studio and use the Google Pixel 2 emulator. 

#### Note: At any time, you can reset to the default setting by tapping the background.

##### Tap "Click to Change Text Color" to change the "Hello from LaToya!" text from *white* to *dark purple*
##### Tap "Click to Change Background Color" to change background from *light purple* to *dark mode*
##### Tap "Hello from LaToya!" text to change to "Android is Awesome"
##### To display your own message, enter the your message where it says, "Enter your own text here", then tap, "Click to Change to Custom Text"
